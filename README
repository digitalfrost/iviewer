This is a fork of http://wiki.github.com/can3p/iviewer which makes the click function independent of the drag function so that the click function isn't triggered at the end of a drag.

Jquery.iviewer plugin allows to view image in selected div with zoom controls and
possibility to move image in area by mouse.
